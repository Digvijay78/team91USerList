# User List Application

## Overview

This is a dynamic React application that displays a list of users fetched from a mock API. The application showcases the use of React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and lifecycle methods. Each user in the list has a toggle button to change their active status, and the UI updates in real-time when the active status is changed. The application is styled using CSS to ensure responsiveness and a pleasant user experience.
